# Form Validation Mini Project

In a bid to learn and improve my knowledge on __Frontend__ development I decided to follow this tutorial in building a mini form validation project.  
The project makes use of no frameworks but rather use pure css and vanilla js to implement styling and interactive behaviour as well as form validations.  
Working on this project I have learned a lot about structuring project with _html_, css styling and some very cool tricks/short cuts on vscode to make my development process a lot more fun.

## Technologies:
The following technologies were used to realize this project.

### HMTL:
The basic structure and layout of the application is implemented using HTML5.

### CSS:
The application is styled using custom css styling with CSS3.

### Font Awesome:
I used font awesome icons to style and make elegant the form input fields as well as handle error displays.

### Icon:
I also got some icons for the google and facebook sign up buttons from __Icons8__ website where i used them as _svg_

### JavaScript:
JavaScript was used to implement form validations, ensuring that user input is of the correct format and form can only be submitted if the input data meets defined standards. Incorrect form submission is met with errors thrown where necessary to indicate areas needing corretion.

## Usage:  
Using the application is pretty straighforward. Just open the index file with chrome or any browser of your choosing and play around.

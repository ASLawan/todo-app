# TODO app
The __TODO APP__ is a very simple but elegantly implemented application that allows one to perform CRUD operations directly from the app iteslf in setting up and scheduling tasks.

The application is intended to give the user a very simple UI to work with. Allows user to create tasks. Each task consists of:
- Title  
- Date  
- Description

The user can edit created tasks in case of errors. They can also delete tasks after they have been completed.

## Technologies used:
To build this app, a couple of web technologies have been used to realize the end product. Though the application implements  CRUD it is purely a __frontend__ application as it makes use of localstorage from the browser.

### HMTL: 
The basic structure and layout of the application is implemented using HTML5.

### CSS:
The application is styled using frontend framework and custom css styling with CSS3.  

### Bootstrap5 
To help facilitate application design and layout, I made use of bootstrap to harnese the custom styling from css.

### Font Awesome
I used font awesome icons to style the edit and delete buttons.

### JavaScript
To implement dynamic behaviour in the application, I used JavaScript to handle events enabling users to perform CRUD operations:
- Create tasks  
- Read tasks  
- Update tasks      
- Delete tasks

## Usage:
Using the application is pretty straighforward. Just open the index file with chrome or any browser of your choosing and play around.


## To be done;
I will implement a feature that user can tick off implemented tasks if the do not want to delete them yet.

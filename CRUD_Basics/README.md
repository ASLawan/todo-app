To learn __CRUD__ basics in JavaScripts, I just followed this tutorial simulating a simple application.

## Technologies used

### CSS3
- To style the application, I made use of custom css to handle basic appearance and font-awesome for icons

### JavaScript

    - Read posts  
    - Update posts  
    - Delete posts

## Usage
